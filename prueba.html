<h2>Interest in IT</h2>
  <h3>•	What is your interest in IT? When did your interest in IT start? </h3>
  <p>Since little, I’ve always had an interest in TI (probably due to my lifelong casual gamer career), yet my knowledge since then has been somewhat superficial. In my house I’m usually the one that sets ups TVs, sound systems, gaming consoles, phone backups and sometimes fix the wi-fi by restarting the router, like I said before, superficial. Nonetheless I have always liked the idea of technology as a tool, if used properly and in a healthy manner I believe it makes our everyday life easier. I’m very interested in promoting said idea, and maybe building my professional career around it.</p>
  <h3>•	Was there a particular event or person that sparked your interest? Outline your IT experience (if any). </h3>
  <p>In my case there wasn’t any event or person that ignited my interest, I just feel comfortable around computers. I’m not as involved in IT as I would like. Basically, my only experience is related to my current studies back in Mexico. I’m in an undergraduate program of Business Intelligence, where I have gained experience mainly related to data and statistics. I know the very basics of python, r, and SQL, and have a little more advanced knowledge in visualization tools such as power bi and tableau. Thanks to a teacher I was able to get a job at Palacio de Hierro, which is a big departmental store in Mexico. I worked in the analytics team, focusing on ecommerce.</p>
