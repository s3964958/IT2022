<h1>Interest in TI</h1>
  <hr>

<h3>What is your interest in IT? When did your interest in IT start?</h3>

<p>Since little, I’ve always had an interest in TI (probably due to my lifelong casual gamer career), yet my knowledge since then has been somewhat superficial. In my house, I’m usually the one that sets ups TVs, sound systems, gaming consoles, phone backups, and sometimes fix the wi-fi by restarting the router, like I said before, is superficial. Nonetheless, I have always liked the idea of technology as a tool, if used properly and in a healthy manner, I believe it makes our everyday life easier. I’m very interested in promoting the said idea and maybe building my professional career around it.</p>

<h3>Was there a particular event or person that sparked your interest? Outline your IT experience (if any).</h3>

<p>In my case there wasn’t any event or person that ignited my interest, I just feel comfortable around computers. I’m not as involved in IT as I would like. Basically, my only experience is related to my current studies back in Mexico. I’m in an undergraduate program in Business Intelligence, where I have gained experience mainly related to data and statistics. I know the very basics of python, r, and SQL, and have a little more advanced knowledge in visualization tools such as power bi and tableau. Thanks to a teacher I was able to get a job at Palacio de Hierro, which is a big departmental store in Mexico. I worked in the analytics team, focusing on e-commerce.</p>

<h3>Why did you choose to come to RMIT?</h3>

  <br>
<p>For my 7th semester in Mexico, I was offered the opportunity to go to an exchange program. There was a huge list with many schools in more than 70 countries. The way it worked is that everyone could apply for 7 different schools/destinations and the system determines one by one if you get accepted or not based on the available spots and your grades. The most popular destinations were in Europe, but I wanted to try something different, that thought led me to Australia, and then to Melbourne. Finally, I received my offer letter from RMIT, I didn’t hesitate to accept.</p>

<h3>What do you expect to learn during your studies?</h3>
<br>
<p>I’ll be at RMIT for a short period of time (6 months), and I intend to make the best out of it. I have great expectations for the academic part as the teaching methods here are completely different from the ones we have back home. The environment is also great, city campus filled with students and professors is a good sight after a long lockdown. I also have great expectations for learning outside the classroom. Living on my own and in a whole new city is exactly what I need at this point in my life.</p>
