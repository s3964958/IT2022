<h3>Position Description</h3>
  <br>
      <p>
The job offer that I choose is a consultant position for Google cloud services. In this position, there is a lot of direct interaction with the customers, as the job basically consists in attending to them to incorporate and deploy google cloud solutions for their businesses. What makes this offer appealing is somewhat related to what I mentioned earlier, technology can make people's life easier, and Google Cloud Services is just one example of it. I would like to help customers from around the world adopt innovations such as the cloud to improve their businesses, and what better cloud service than Google, a great product and a great place to work in.

<h3>Skills, qualifications, and experience required</h3>
  <br>
      <p>
As you would expect for such an appealing position, the qualifications are rigorous. First, I’ll talk about the minimum qualifications and then I’ll continue with the preferred ones. The first minimum qualification refers to the area of study, as you will need a bachelor's degree in computer science, computer engineering, or something related to that field. Secondly, you will need general experience to apply for this job, at least 5 years in project managing and solutions delivery. Finally, in addition to the previously mentioned, you’ll need experience in more specific fields, primarily those related to data processing systems and cloud environments. Now, in summary, the preferred qualifications consist in having an MBA in computer science, completing their cloud certification, having experience in one or more coding languages such as Java, JavaScript, or Python, and lastly, experience developing large-scale data processing systems.

  <br>

<h3>Current Skills, qualifications, and experience </h3>
  <br>
      <p>
Currently, I’m in the 7th semester of my undergraduate program in Business Intelligence, which I can gladly say is somewhat related to the bachelor's degrees mentioned above. Throughout my studies, I’ve collaborated with big companies such as Coppel, Oxxo, and Coca-Cola FEMSA. I’ve also begun to develop my programming skills in python and r, even though I still have a lot to learn it is reassuring to see this in the preferred qualifications. I have also concluded an introductory course imparted by Google Cloud where we skimmed through many of their services and revised a little bit of SQL. In terms of experience, I, along with other peers, founded a youth sales team for Total play, a Mexican technology, telecommunications, and entertainment company. I have also worked as an intern data analyst for Palacio de Hierro and its e-commerce team.

  <br>

<h3>Plan and next Steps </h3>
  <br>
      <p>
I would say that my most imminent step is to finish my study abroad program. After that on my return to Mexico, I would like to focus on two things, finish my studies at the Tecnologico de Monterrey and find a good intern job in a leading technology company. This will allow me to continue developing my skills and most importantly find what it is that I like the most. I’m also interested in completing an MBA. Finally, I believe it’s important to take courses and certifications related to the latest trends, such as Google Cloud, AWS, IBM, and more.
