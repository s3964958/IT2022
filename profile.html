<p>I believe the information provided by these three tests is valuable. Regardless of how much I agree or disagree with them is a good introspection exercise that I probably wouldn't be doing otherwise. Now, going in-depth at the results, even though there are some parts that I don't agree with, such as being extroverted, I'm inclined to say that I agree with most of it. Furthermore. analyzing them from a team point of view, I can confidently say that I possess good traits for teamworking, an example could be the Agreeableness result provided by the five personality test, or the Assertive trait provided by the Myers-Briggs Test. I believe that in order to form a good team it's important to find someone that complements my personality, someone that is organized and delivers on time and form would be ideal.</p>
