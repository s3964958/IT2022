<h1>Project Idea</h1>
  <hr>

<h3>Overview</h3>


<p>My project idea consists of two parts. First, an easy-to-access, and user-friendly chatbot. The main purpose of the chatbot will be for complaints, more specifically discrimination complaints. The user will be able to submit a complaint in less than five minutes, which will then be automatically uploaded to a database for further analysis. This leads to the second part of the project. I also want to build a data visualization tool that will contain all the complaints from the users, dividing the information into categories, such as location, industry (restaurants, bars, clubs, offices, etc), and more. The objective is to make this information available to the public as well.</p>

<h3>Motivation</h3>
<br>

<br><img src="sonora.png" alt="me" width="400" height="300">

<p>I'm an exchange student from Mexico. Back home, in our day-to-day lives, we get to witness many acts of discrimination of all sorts. People raise their voices and make large movements and complaints on social media about specific cases, yet, many others go unnoticed. The main problem is that even those that catch the attention of many, with time get forgotten. I believe that this frustration can be focused on developing a tool that will help with the fight against discrimination around the world. Australia represents a great opportunity thanks to the advanced technological culture, and more importantly the immense cultural diversity. According to the Australian Human Rights Commission, “One in four of Australia’s 22 million people were born overseas; 46% have at least one parent who was born overseas; nearly 20% of Australians speak a language other than English at home”, yet ‘One in ten Australians (1.5 million of the nation’s adult population) believe that some races are inferior or superior to others”  and 18% of Australians surveyed said they had experienced discrimination because of skin colour, ethnic origin or religion.[8] The most often reported location of discrimination was the neighbourhood (58 per cent), followed by shopping centers (42.8 per cent) and at work (39 per cent) (AHRC, 2022).</p>

<h3>Description</h3>

  <br>
<p>As I mentioned above, the project will be divided into two parts. The first part consists of the chatbot and its functionalities. The idea of a chatbot surged from the desire of having an easy-to-access tool, something fast enough that will allow users to submit their complaints in less than five minutes, with the chatbot, anyone who has a smartphone will be able to do it with just a few clicks. That leads to the second objective for the chatbot. Apart from it being easy to access it is very important for it to be user-friendly. Any person has to be able to use it, regardless of their technological skills. That is why the idea is to do simple questions that are easy to follow. Some examples could be gender, age, skin color, location, name of the establishment, and more. This information could lead to very helpful insights later on. A key role for this chatbot is data collection. The idea is that as soon as the complaint has been sent it will automatically upload to a database where it will be stored for further analysis. Once we have the data we move on to the next part of the project. For this part, the idea is to develop a dashboard visualization that anyone can access online. The visualization is going to be live, meaning that it will update as soon as someone sends a complaint. It is very important that not only the chatbot is user-friendly, but the dashboard too, if one of them fails to do so it will jeopardize the main goal and with it, the whole project as well. In an attempt of improving the understanding of the data, the visualization will have filters, categories, and maps, additionally, the dashboard will be fully interactive. This dashboard will be published online meaning that anyone with an internet connection is going to be able to explore it. The database utilized will also be available online, it can be downloaded so people can do their own analysis. There will not be any security issues as the process of uploading a complaint is fully anonymous and does not capture any personal details. It is important to clarify that this will only serve as a tool, it will be a source of information for anyone who is interested, such as individuals, non-governmental organizations, or the government itself. Finally, I want to highlight that the whole project is meant to be non-profit. Both, the chatbot and the dashboard will be completely free, there will be no ads, or fees to download the data. Only with the help of donations, the costs will be covered. It is a tool to help the fight against discrimination, a tool to help people, not a product for sale. </p>

<h3>Tools and Technologies</h3>

<br>
<p>There are many online tools that help with the creation of a chatbot. According to Forbes, the best chatbot creation tools in 2022 are HubSpot, Intercom, Drift, Salesforce, WP-Chatbot, LivePerson, and Genesys DX (Forbes, 2022). I have previously worked with the creation tool provided by IBM and it's very friendly, yet I am not sure of its economic feasibility. The idea of taking the complaints and uploading them into the dashboard automatically involves many steps in between. It is important that the data obtained from the chatbot is cleaned, and in order to do this automatically there will be some code to develop, this can be done in many languages but my recommendation is with python or r. Finally, some alternatives for the data visualization tool could be google data studio, power bi, and tableau.</p>

<p>My main concern in terms of requirements is the economic feasibility of the chatbot creation tool. Most of the alternatives that offer a good chatbot with automatic updates are not very cheap. Nonetheless, some variations to the project could be done in order to achieve lower economic goals. Cleaning data is always time-consuming and tiring, making this process automatic requires beginning to intermediate coding skills in r and/or python, r studio and anaconda are completely free. Lastly, the data visualization tools I mentioned above are if not free for everyone, available for students. Even though they are friendly to use, some experience in the creation of dashboards would be ideal. </p>

<h3>Outcome</h3>
<br>
<p>When the project is finished, we will be able to help. Provide those in need with a channel for them to raise their voice, a platform where they will be listened to, and more importantly not forgotten. If executed correctly, every case of discrimination will be stored in the databases and will not wash away when the next trending topic in social media arises. Organizations of all sorts will have access to the data, and informed actions can be taken, establishments and people can now be exposed and held accountable for their actions. The proper use of this project could really make a difference.</p>
